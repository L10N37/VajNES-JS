WIP: https://l10n37.github.io/VajNES-JS/debug


To do: a million things, but once passing all 6502 tests, create a backend/ API that we can post instructions/ opcodes to in 6502 and receive an object back containing CPU state for 6502 emulation testing.

since deciding to go multithreading, which it was a surprise you could even do in JS, and which is a cool learning experience, this app will not work without local copy downloaded/ live server set up (i am using node live-server.js). But, i am 500,000 commits away from a working emulator, so realistically, theres nothing to see anyway!
